/**
 * An individual aircraft management record:
 * Either FREE or models an aircraft currently known to SAAMS.
 * See MRState diagram for operational details, and written documentation.
 * This class has public static int identifiers for the individual status codes.
 * An MR may be "FREE", or may contain a record of the status of an individual aircraft under the management of SAAMS.
 * An instance of AircraftManagementDatabase holds a collection of ManagementRecords, and sends the ManagementRecords messages to control/fetch their status.
